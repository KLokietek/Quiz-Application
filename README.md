A system enabling users to create, save, and run quizzes using the terminal. 
The application is connected to a database using Entity Framework Core and LINQ.
Database project, built using the "code-first" approach with migrations. 
The data for the database, which I was saving during the creation of this system, was SQL Server Management Studio 19.
